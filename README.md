# Scalatra sbt project #


[g8](http://github.com/n8han/giter8) template to get a Scalatra web service up and running quickly.

## Use this template ##

- [Install giter8 (g8)](https://github.com/n8han/giter8)
- Get the g8 template and run it:

```sh
$ g8 scalatra/scalatra-sbt
$ cd <name-of-app>
$ ./sbt
> container:start
```

- Open [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) in your browser.

### This Fork

Fixes the sbt version to 0.13.8 and eliminates the complexity of the sbt
script by relying on the fixed version included with the template.
